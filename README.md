> :milky_way:  Neil deGrasse Tyson -"When I look up at the night sky and I know that yes, we are part of this universe, we are in this universe, but perhaps more important than both of those facts is that the universe is in us."

I am a student at  Federal University of ABC :office: pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Science and Technology :microscope: whose motivation is nothing but passion. Apart from that I am also a Mechatronics Technician and currently into learning more about programming :computer:. I love to discover how things work, and I believe that's why I am always exploring new subjects and figuring out how they are connected with each other.
